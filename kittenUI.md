[UI Kitten](https://akveo.github.io/react-native-ui-kitten/) is the used component library in this application. It makes it easier to achieve a constant styling theme and reduces the development time. It provides multiple special components like a `Datepicker` but also improves default components like `Button` to allow easier customisability by providing new parameters like `appearance`. All in all it allows nearly all components to have a status (`basic`, `primary`, `success`, `info`, `warning` and `danger`) and according to this special styles.
